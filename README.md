# Requirements
This project requires a Pi Pico and quadruped robot, as well as the TKinter library to run the GUI, as well as the free programs Thonny and Visual Studio Code (VSC)

# Setup
After initial setup of each program, open the quadruped_code file in VSC, and the quadruped_code_pico file in Thonny. Run the file in Thonny, and then close the program. This will keep the code running on the pico in the background. Then, run the quadruped_code file in VSC. This will open the GUI. You can now use the program. 

To save a file, use the Update Positions button, then type the file name you want to save to in the text box, then click Save all Positions. To load, simply type in the name again and click Load all positions. There is also an in-built Wave button, which will make the robot wave it's front left leg at you.
